hemlo there

i'm an average person like you, making random stuff in my free time if i have.

trying to learn webdev stuff via ~~nvim~~ helix/termux

~~the lsp is broken, i dont know why~~

~~even helix's lsp is probably broken, i guess this is android's side then~~

found a solution for it, details in blog.

~~anyways is there something better than blogger? its the only blogsite that i know for now.~~

nevermind, already used github pages.
